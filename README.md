# ECS

A C++ Entity Component System.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local
machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project is meant to be only a template, thus versions of the software used
can be change to better suit the needs of the developer(s). If you wish to use the
template *as-is*, meaning using the versions recommended here, then you will need:

* **CMake v3.15+** - found at [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)

* **C++ Compiler** - needs to support at least the **C++17** standard, i.e. *MSVC*,
*GCC*, *Clang*

> ***Note:*** *You also need to be able to provide ***CMake*** a supported
[generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).*

## Building the project

To build the project, all you need to do is run a similar **CMake** routine
to the the one below:

```bash
mkdir build/ && cd build/
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory
cmake --build . --target install
```

> ***Note:*** *The custom ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` can be omitted if you wish to
install in [the default install location](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html).*

More options that you can set for the project can be found in the
[`cmake/StandardSettings.cmake` file](cmake/StandardSettings.cmake). For certain
options additional configuration may be needed in their respective `*.cmake` files
(i.e. Conan needs the `CONAN_REQUIRES` and might need the `CONAN_OPTIONS` to be setup
for it work correctly; the two are set in the [`cmake/Conan.cmake` file](cmake/Conan.cmake)).

## Generating the documentation

In order to generate documentation for the project, you need to configure the build
to use Doxygen. This is easily done, by modifying the workflow shown above as follows:

```bash
mkdir build/ && cd build/
cmake .. -D<project_name>_ENABLE_DOXYGEN=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory
cmake --build . --target doxygen-docs
```

> ***Note:*** *This will generate a `docs/` directory in the **project's root directory**.*

## Running the tests

By default, the template uses [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/)
for unit testing. Unit testing can be disabled in the options, by setting the
`ENABLE_UNIT_TESTING` (from
[cmake/StandardSettings.cmake](cmake/StandardSettings.cmake)) to be false. To run
the tests, simply use CTest, from the build directory, passing the desire
configuration for which to run tests for. An example of this procedure is:

```bash
cd build          # if not in the build directory already
ctest -C Release  # or `ctest -C Debug` or any other configuration you wish to test

# you can also run tests with the `-VV` flag for a more verbose output (i.e.
#GoogleTest output as well)
```
